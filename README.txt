		Wordpress Blogs Comment AUTOMATION
This script goes to wordpress blogs websites specified in the 'sites.csv' file and posts comment on each article by specifying number of the pages.
This script follows one flow so add websites who have the same flow of commenting. 
-> name, email, website, and comment is the only fields. Enter all the fields correctly.
-> If you want add more webpages then add the webpage home links in 'sites.csv' file.
-> Run button will start your process.
-> Clear button will clear all the fields.
-> To stop the process close the opened chrome browser window.
-> The chromebrowser is running using undetected_chromebrower library because it has recaptcha on its page.
-> You can use your default chrome profile by adding 'user-data-dir' in the script.
	Uncomment the line under uc chrome options and add profile path by searching 'chrome://version' in your chrome browser.
	Copy the profile path and paste it in the argument.
